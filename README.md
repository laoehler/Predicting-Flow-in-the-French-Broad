# Predicting-Flow-in-the-French-Broad
This is a collection of work I have done to build a supervised learning model which is designed to predict the level of flow in the French Broad river based off of USGS and NOAA data. Contained in this repository is all the code I used to process the data and train models in addition to the processed data I used.
